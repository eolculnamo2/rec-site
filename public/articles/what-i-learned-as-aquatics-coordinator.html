        <p>
            I became a lifeguard at the YMCA the summer before I started graduate school. I was in school for theology which involved much reading, writing, and time devoted to philosophy. The richest lessons I learned during the years spent in graduate school were learned outside the classroom at the YMCA.

        <p>
            The truth of the matter is that I had almost no job experience and that I was led to believe that the secret to success was more school. Because of this, I was shocked at how unprepared I was for the challenges of organizing a small town YMCA swim lesson program as a newly promoted swim lesson coordinator.

        <h3>
            #1 I learned that I needed guidance
        </h3>

        <p>
            The executive director met with me once per week when I started my new role. His guidance was invaluable and I carry his lessons with me to this day. He kept me honest, he taught me to accept responsibility for my program when things went wrong (even when it wasn’t my fault), and pushed me to be creative in the way we appealed to members. The reason guidance like this is so invaluable is that you do not know as much as someone who is more experienced and you WILL inevitably learn the hard way if you do not get their help. Not only that, if someone takes you under their wing, they can watch out for you and your career as you look to advance.

        <h3>
            #2 I learned that people will let you down
        </h3>

        <p>
            This might be the hardest reality to face when starting a job in recreation. You work with a lot of younger staff who still have a lot of growing up to do. I remember a Saturday morning, I got a phone call that 2-3 of my swim lesson instructors did not show up to their 9AM shift. I had to face the parents who got up early on their day off. If you are not able to properly react and prevent situations like these, you will have a hard time in the recreation world. When people let you down, you learn that you cannot agreeably let them ‘get away with it.’ You have to draw clear lines and discipline. Of course, this must be balanced by learning opportunities and putting a positive spin on bad situations.

        <h3>
            #3 I learned that hard work is respected
        </h3>

        <p>
            In the recreation world, there are times when things get relaxed -- sometimes too relaxed. In such cases, your boss is looking for people who are willing to go the extra mile for the sake of maintaining high standards for your facility. As hard as it is at times, the Aquatics world needs people who can be there on nights and weekends when the pools are crowded. As a coordinator or director, your influence over your staff and programs can be greatly helped by going the extra mile by being will to work weekends, spend extra time on training/development of guards, and double checking your work.
